# FMOD demo and project setup

The ready-made scene is `Assets/Scenes/FMODDemo.luxscene`. It uses your existing
`event:/Fart` from `Assets/Audio/SampleProject/SampleProject.fspro`.
The engine already builds with FMOD Core, FMOD Studio, and Vercidium Audio (VA).
You do not need a Unity/Unreal integration package or another audio backend toggle.

## Run the supplied scene

1. Start the rebuilt editor from the repository root:
   ```sh
   LUX_SKIP_BUILD=1 ./scripts/Linux-Run.sh release
   ```
2. Open `Editor/LuxSampleProject/LuxSample.luxproj` if it is not already open.
3. If the editor was running while the scripts were built, stop Play and choose
   **Edit > Reload C# Assembly** (`Ctrl+R`). This reloads the compiled DLL; it does not compile source.
4. Open `Assets/Scenes/FMODDemo.luxscene` from the Content Browser, or use the scene-open dialog.
5. Press **Play**, then click the game viewport to give it keyboard focus. The source plays once
   on startup. The console should report `FMOD Demo ready`.
6. Hold the right mouse button and use **W/A/S/D** to move the listener. **Q/E** move down/up,
   and **Left Shift** increases speed. Walk around the wall and compare near/far positions.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| K | Restart the Audio Source component's event |
| L | Fire an additional one-shot at the emitter position |
| I | Start/restart an independently owned event instance |
| P | Pause/resume the component's event |
| O | Stop the component and independently owned instance |

One-shots finish naturally; O cannot cancel them. `L` requires an event authored as a finite
one-shot. For looping events, use K or I. Stop Play before rebuilding/reloading banks.

The camera already has `LuxSample.FlyCamera` and an Audio Listener (index 0, weight 1).
The emitter already has `LuxSample.FmodAudioDemo` and an Audio Source. The script's `PlayOnStart`
field controls startup playback; the component's Play On Awake is off to prevent duplicate starts.
The floor and wall have mesh colliders for VA's geometry collection.

## Link an FMOD Studio project to Lux

1. Use FMOD Studio **2.03.x**, matching the installed FMOD Engine SDK series (2.03.14).
   For this sample, open `Assets/Audio/SampleProject/SampleProject.fspro` in FMOD Studio.
2. Create/select an event and put an audio instrument in it. Confirm it plays inside Studio.
   For position/distance testing, author it as a 3D event with a Spatializer on its output.
3. Right-click the event in Studio's Events browser and choose **Assign to Bank > Browse > Master**.
   Unassigned events are not included in bank builds.
4. In Studio, choose **File > Build...**. With the normal Desktop platform output, verify that
   `Build/Desktop/Master.bank` and `Build/Desktop/Master.strings.bank` exist beside the `.fspro`.
   If you use additional content banks, build those too.
5. In Lux, open **View > Project Settings**, then its **Audio** section. Enter:

   | Setting | Value for this sample | Relative to |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Studio Project (.fspro) | `Audio/SampleProject/SampleProject.fspro` | The Lux project's `Assets` directory |
   | Bank Output | `Build/Desktop` | The directory containing the `.fspro` |

   **Bank Output is a directory, not `Master.bank`.** These values are already configured for the sample.
6. Save the project settings and reopen the Lux project. Lux loads the banks on project open.
   The Audio section should show loaded banks and events. **View > Audio Debugger** also shows audio status.
7. To let Lux build banks when you press Play, enable **Rebuild Banks On Play**. **Build Banks Now**
   requires FMOD Studio's command-line executable, `fmodstudiocl`. If Lux cannot find it, either
   build manually in Studio or launch Lux with `LUX_FMOD_STUDIO_CL` set to its absolute executable path.
8. In the demo scene, select **FMOD Emitter - Fart**. Change the script's **EventPath** to your
   event's full path (for example, `event:/SFX/Explosion`). Change **MasterBank** and **StringsBank**
   if using a different project. The script's bank paths are relative to **Assets**, unlike Bank Output.
   If the event lives in another content bank, add an `Audio.LoadBank(...)` call for that file before
   `Audio.CreateInstance(...)`. The script sets the component event on startup.
9. Build changed C# source, then reload the assembly in Lux while stopped:
   ```sh
   Editor/LuxSampleProject/Assets/Scripts/Linux-GenProjects.sh
   dotnet build Editor/LuxSampleProject/Assets/Scripts/LuxSample.csproj -c Release
   ```
   The demo scripts are already generated and built. Re-run generation after adding new script files.
10. Open the demo scene and press Play. FMOD playback uses built banks; the Studio application does
    not need to remain open for ordinary playback.

FMOD's official [quick-start tutorial](https://www.fmod.com/docs/2.03/studio/quick-start-tutorial.html)
explains assigning an event and building the Master/strings banks.

## Optional live connection to Studio

Enable **Live Update** in Lux's Project Settings > Audio, save, then reopen the project so FMOD
initializes with live update enabled. Start Play. In FMOD Studio choose **File > Connect to Game...**
and connect to `localhost` (`127.0.0.1`, default port 9264). This is for tuning the running mix;
regular event playback only needs the bank files. Rebuild banks to preserve authored changes for
future runs. Live update is disabled in Dist builds.

See FMOD's [connection instructions](https://qa.fmod.com/t/how-to-use-the-profiler-in-fmod-studio/11138).

## VA occlusion and reverb

The wall supplies geometry to VA, but a Studio event must author how VA affects its sound.
Lux supplies optional event parameters named **Occlusion** and **ReverbSend**, each from 0 to 1.
Add those parameters to your event and automate a low-pass/level reduction and reverb send,
respectively. Rebuild its bank afterward. Without that authoring, 3D distance attenuation can work
while the wall does not audibly muffle the event. The K/component path receives scene acoustics;
the L and I paths demonstrate independent playback and do not automatically register VA targets.

## If it is silent

- Check the Lux console for the actual bank path/event error.
- `event:/...` paths need the strings bank and must match the authored event exactly.
- The event must be assigned to a bank, and that bank must be built and loaded.
- Press K after a short sound finishes. Make sure the viewport has focus.
- Check the FMOD event/master bus volume and the operating system's audio output.
- Reopen Play after replacing banks so the script recreates its event instance.
