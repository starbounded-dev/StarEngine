	-- Deploy the Coral.Managed host assembly next to the editor (Editor/DotNet), which is the
	-- CoralDirectory ScriptEngine points HostInstance at. Mirrors Hazel's Hazel-project postbuild.
	--
	-- PINNED TO RELEASE, deliberately, and not %{cfg.buildcfg}. Coral.Managed is deployed twice by
	-- two independent paths: here, into Editor/DotNet (what the Coral host loads), and by
	-- ScriptCore's ProjectReference into Editor/Resources/Scripts (what ScriptCore.deps.json
	-- resolves). ScriptCore is built by dotnet in Release, so following Core's config here would
	-- put a Debug Coral in one directory and a Release Coral in the other.
	--
	-- Two Coral.Managed assemblies with the same identity but different IL then end up in one
	-- process, and because Coral marshals through raw function pointers, the native side runs
	-- against offsets from the other build. That surfaces as
	-- "System.BadImageFormatException: Bad IL range" on the next script reload, which does not
	-- point anywhere near the actual cause.
	--
	-- On Linux this is also the only correct source: the Coral.Managed premake project is a
	-- StaticLib stub there (see Core/vendor/Coral/Coral.Managed/premake5.lua), so premake never
	-- produces the C# assembly at all and Build/Release is written solely by dotnet.
